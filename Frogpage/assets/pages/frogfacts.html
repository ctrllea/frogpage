        Frogs are obligate carnivores meaning that they cannot survive without
        meat in their diet. Adult frogs eat insects, small mammals, small
        amphibians, small fish, and small birds. Frogs are omnivores as tadpoles
        and transform into carnivores as adults.
      </li>

        Froglets, or Baby Frogs, eat small bugs, small fish, and smaller frogs.
        They may eat crickets, flys, mosquitos, fruit flies, guppies, minnows,
        small moths, small snails, small worms, tadpoles, and other froglets.
      </li>

        Frogs eat their own skin. This is very common for amphibians and is a
        process called “sloughing.” Frogs naturally shed and eat their skin
        which contains nutrients and protein. They do so to stay healthy and
        their tracks from predators.
      </li>
      <li>
        Frogs breathe through their skin, lungs, nostrils, and the lining of
        their mouth. The type of respiration used will vary depending on where
        the frog is located. Before metamorphosis into an adult frog, tadpoles
        breathe through their gills.
      </li>

        Frogs can trill, chirp, scream, bark, grunt, peep, beep, cluck, croak,
        quack, whistle, bellow, and hoot. But their choice of sound depends on
        their intent. Frogs make different sounds for different reasons, for
        example, to attract a mate, defend their territory, or fend off a
        predator.

        You can tell the age of a frog based on the bone rings inside of frogs
        bones. During hibernation, frogs form a new layer of bone and so just
        like with trees. And so, one can find out the age of a frog from the
        rings in its bones.

        Tadpoles, also called polliwogs, are the aquatic larval stage of frogs
        that evolves from frog eggs after 3 to 25 days. They measure about
        40-45mm and live in water. Tadpoles evolve as tadpoles for 14 to 16
        weeks depending on the species and the climate in which they live.

        Tree Frogs are excellent at climbing. Arboreal frogs, or frogs that live
        in trees, are generally small in size and have padded toes that allow
        them to climb and easily stick to trees and leaves.

        All toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads. Toads are a
        subclassification of frogs, which means that all toads are frogs, but
        not all frogs are toads. Frogs and toads are both part of the Anura
        family, but toads generally have warts, shorter legs, and live on land.
